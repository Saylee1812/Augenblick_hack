Industrial machines generate vast amounts of sensor data, including temperature, pressure, and vibration readings. Unexpected failures can lead to significant downtime and costly repairs, making predictive maintenance a critical challenge. Our solution leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze sensor data, detect anomalies, and predict failures before they occur. By implementing supervised and unsupervised models, we develop an AI-driven system that enhances maintenance planning and reduces operational disruptions. This presentation will cover our approach, including the models used, data preprocessing steps, visualization techniques, and an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring..

Data sets used:
1)FD001 (C-MAPSS Dataset - Jet Engine RUL Prediction)
A subset of the C-MAPSS dataset used to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of jet engines.
Contains 100 training engines and 100 test engines, all operating under a single condition (Sea Level) with one fault mode (HPC Degradation).
HPC Degradation: The High-Pressure Compressor (HPC) loses efficiency over time, leading to higher temperatures, reduced pressure ratios, and increased fuel consumption.

2)MVTec AD - Metal Nut Anomaly Detection
A real-world dataset for visual anomaly detection in metal nuts.
Includes defective and normal samples, used to train models for detecting irregularities in manufacturing.
This dataset helps in automating quality inspection by enabling machine learning models to identify defects with high precision, reducing manual inspection efforts and improving production efficiency.

3)Predictive Maintenance Dataset (AI4I 2020) 
10,000 data points with 14 features (temperature, speed, torque, tool wear).
5 Failure Modes: Tool wear, heat dissipation, power, overstrain, and random failures.
Used to train predictive maintenance models for failure detection & anomaly detection.
Helps in preventive maintenance by predicting failures before they occur, reducing downtime.
